# video-cleanup.sh — reap abandoned per-clip video themes.
#
# Every theme created by video-theme.sh carries a .video-theme marker. A
# marked theme is kept while it is the active theme or registered in the
# cycle list (~/.config/omarchy/video-themes). Anything else is considered
# abandoned and is removed, so it stops appearing in the stock theme
# selector (Omarchy lists every theme in ~/.config/omarchy/themes and has
# no hidden-theme mechanism). Stale cycle-list entries (themes that no
# longer exist) are pruned as well.
#
# Unmarked themes — including the multi-clip library theme (video-wallpaper)
# and every normal theme — are never touched.
#
# Silent by design: the video tools run it on every invocation.
